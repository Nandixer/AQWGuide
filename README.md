# AQW Guide

AQW Guide is a companion app made for the MMORPG Adventure Quest Worlds.
`android`

It offers guides for classes, ultra fights, with more features coming soon, such as farming and color-matching sets.

## Is this official?

Not at all.
I'm just an Android developer who likes the game, and I'm not connected to Artix Entertainment in any form.
The "AQW" in the name is just to make it clear what the guide app is for.

## Is this safe?

See for yourself!
The entirety of the app's source code is publicly visible in this repository.
No trackers, no data collection.

## How can I contact you?

If you have a GitHub account, create an issue in the project's issue tracker.
I can also be found on Discord as `nandixer`.

## Why isn't this in the Play Store?

Mostly because apps uploaded to the play store have to be built for the latest version of Android.
I wanted to make sure that players without access to the newest phones can use the app.

## I found a bug!

Please let me know how to reproduce it and I'll fix it!

## Can I contribute?

Suggestions are always welcome.
Also, I don't have data (ratings, builds, damage tests) for all classes.
Would love some extra testers.

Pull requests also welcome.
